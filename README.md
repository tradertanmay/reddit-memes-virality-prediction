To replicate the results, please execute the cells in the memes_download.ipynb notebook sequentially. Keep the following points in mind:

Ensure that config.py and memes_scrapper.py are located in the same folder as the memes_download.ipynb file.
The PRAW library is required, along with the following Reddit API credentials: REDDIT_CLIENT_ID, REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET, and REDDIT_USER_AGENT. Please ensure these are correctly set up.
Modify the paths in the script to specify where you wish to store the downloaded memes and the associated metadata.
The downloaded memes will be stored in the specified directory (replace [xxxx] with the actual path), and the metadata will be saved in a file named memes_metadata.csv within the same repository."
